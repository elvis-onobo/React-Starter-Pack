# React Starter Pack
The goal of the React Starter Pack is to make numerous components readily available for React Js developers to start work on any project quickly. Rather than build new components every time, you can just grab the components from here and advance it.
It is sort of like an admin template except that admin templates are usually so packed that you have to start tearing them up for what you need. On the other hand, with the React Starter Pack, you only pick what you need and use it.

### Contribution
You are welcome to contribute on this project. However, there are just a few conventions to follow:

1. Build every feature as a separate component. For example, Navbar should be a separate component and footer too.
2. Bootstrap is being utilised in the project, however, __any custom CSS should also be placed within the appropriate CSS files and named exactly as the component is was created to style__.
